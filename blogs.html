                <h1>Problems With Agile Methods</h1>
                <small> 26 november 2020</small>
        <p>It can be difficult to keep the interest of customers who are involved in the process.
            Team members may be unsuited to the intense involvement that characterises agile methods.
            Prioritising changes can be difficult where there are multiple stakeholders.
            Maintaining simplicity requires extra work.
            Contracts may be a problem as with other approaches to iterative development.</p>

            <h1>Is Tenses Is Mandatory For Understanding English?</h1>
            <small> 25 november 2020</small>
    <p><strong>Definitely a big no</strong>,because you can speak english by just seeing the peoples around you but when you talk about english skills in wriiten then you have to learn the tenses.

        <h1>Improvement In Agile Development Technique Using Requirement Engineering</h1>
        <small> 22 november 2020</small>
<p>The earth has become a global valley. A fast-growing economy has already changed the way the world works. Older software development methods are losing their appeal in agile development. Agile opens its way to being the first decision for everyone involved in software development. Agile development strategies are another name for delivering software product on time and within budget. As with any other agile development strategy it should have ways to collect and manage needs. </p>

            <h1>Can You Survive Without English?</h1>
            <small>18 november 2020</small>
    <p>The answer is definitely yes because in my opinion.<strong>English is just the language not the measure of intelligence.</strong>
    but it is a greate skill to have.English will act as a bridge between the peoples coming from different background</p>
